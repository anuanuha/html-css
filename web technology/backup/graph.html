     Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) was envisaged in the 1990s to transfer significant payloads
     to geostationary orbit. ISRO initially had a great problem realizing GSLV as the development of CE-7.5 in India 
     took a decade. The US had blocked India from obtaining cryogenic technology from Russia, leading India to develop its
      own cryogenic engines.[29]After the cryogenic issue was resolved, the number of launch failures had considerably decreased. Out of 15 missions, 9 were successful.[53]
      The Indian Space Research Organisation[a] (ISRO; /ˈɪsroʊ/) is the national space agency of India,
       headquartered in Bangalore, which operates under the Department of Space (DOS) and is responsible for 
       conducting space research, space exploration, and the development of technologies necessary for space-based applications.

The International Space Station is a large spacecraft. It orbits around Earth. It is a home where astronauts live.
 The space station is also a science lab. Many countries worked together to build it. They also work together to use it. 
 The space station is made of many pieces. The pieces were put together in space by astronauts. The space station's orbit is approximately 250 miles above Earth. NASA uses the station to learn about living and working in space. These lessons will help NASA explore space.
 NRSA is closely associated with various programmes of the Department of Space (DOS)/Indian Space Research Organisation
 (ISRO), in particular, the Earth Observation Programme, Disaster Management Support and other programmes of national 
 importance. To enable NRSA to carry out its responsibilities in a more effective manner, the Government has after
  careful consideration, decided to convert it into a Government entity, to be called a National Remote Sensing Centre
   (NRSC), a Centre under DOS/ISRO, effective 1 September 2008.
